# ProjectPulse-Analytics
ProjectPulse Analytics uses Python, NumPy, and Pandas to analyze project data for heads, processing employee, seniority, and project info for cost, designation, and metric insights. It fixes missing data, merges datasets, adds 5% bonuses for completed projects, adjusts designations by status/age, and creates cost summaries.
